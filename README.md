What are conditional statements in OOP?

In OOPs, conditional statements are used to tell the computer what action to take in response to certain conditions. The execution flow may alter if a condition is added to a block of statements depending on the result of the condition's evaluation. 

The four conditional statements in Java are: 

if, if-else, else-if ladder, and switch.

The 'if-else' statement executes different code based on whether the condition is true or false. 

The 'switch' statement evaluates an expression and executes the code corresponding to the matching case.
